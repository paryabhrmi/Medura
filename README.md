# Medura

An interactive [Rive](https://rive.app) prototype published as a static site on GitHub Pages.

## Contents

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | The whole site: full-screen canvas, loader, Rive bootstrapping |
| `rive/medura_project_v1.riv` | The Rive file (~1.6 MB) |
| `vendor/rive/` | Pinned `@rive-app/canvas` 2.39.2 runtime (`rive.js` + WebAssembly) |
| `.nojekyll` | Stops Pages from running Jekyll over the files |

Everything is served from this repository — the page makes no third-party
requests, so no CDN outage, version drift, or content blocker can break it.
`index.html` points the runtime at the bundled `.wasm` via
`RuntimeLoader.setWasmUrl()` instead of its default CDN location.

## Deployment

The site is live at **https://paryabhrmi.github.io/Medura/**.

Pages is configured under **Settings → Pages** as *Deploy from a branch*,
serving this branch from the repository root. GitHub rebuilds and republishes
on every push, so no build step or Actions workflow is involved — the files in
this repository are exactly what is served.

`.nojekyll` matters here: without it Pages would run Jekyll, which excludes
`vendor/` from its output by default and would leave the Rive runtime 404ing.

## Running locally

The page uses `fetch()` to read the `.riv` file, which browsers block on
`file://` URLs — serve the folder over HTTP instead:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Notes on behaviour

**The state machine is named explicitly, and that is load-bearing.** Passing
neither `animations` nor `stateMachines` does *not* start the artboard's state
machine — the runtime's `atLeastOne` picks the first *timeline* and only falls
back to a state machine when the artboard has no timelines at all. Since
`ArtboardMaster` has nine timelines, the file rendered, played `Cover` once,
froze, and ignored every click. `stateMachines: "State Machine 1"` fixes it;
`ensureStateMachineRunning()` falls back to whatever the artboard actually has
if that name is changed in the editor.

- `autoBind` and `automaticallyHandleEvents` are on, so the file's data-bound
  view models and its authored Rive events drive themselves.
- Fit is `Fill`, so the artboard covers the viewport with no letterbox bars.
  Fill stretches, which is invisible near the artboard's own ~16:9 shape but
  unreadable on a phone held portrait, so past `MAX_STRETCH` (35%) it falls
  back to `Contain`. Set `MAX_STRETCH = 0` in `index.html` to always stretch.
- The canvas tracks the real device pixel ratio and re-renders on resize and
  rotation, which also keeps pointer hit-testing aligned with the artwork.
- Playback pauses while the tab is hidden.
- Portrait phones get a brief "rotate your device" hint.

Interactivity is covered by a Playwright check that hashes canvas pixels before
and after each pointer event — hover and click on the nav tabs, theme toggle,
organ hotspots and zoom controls all produce real frame changes, on mouse and
on touch.

## Replacing the animation

Drop a new `.riv` file into `rive/` and update `RIV_URL` near the top of the
script block in `index.html`. The page deliberately does not pin an artboard or
state-machine name, so it keeps working when those are renamed in the Rive
editor.

To update the runtime:

```bash
npm pack @rive-app/canvas@latest
tar xzf rive-app-canvas-*.tgz
cp package/rive.js package/rive.wasm package/rive_fallback.wasm vendor/rive/
```
